      <h2>What is Milk Tea</h2>
      <p>
        The history of milke tea originated from Hong Kong, and may have its origins in the introduction of the practice of drinking afternoon tea with milk and sugar under the British colonial rule. The Hong Kong milk tea is made with black tea and evaporated milk or sweetened condensed milk. The tea used is typically a black tea, although other aged tea may also be used such as matcha and assam.

        How milk tea became a staple in Asian-American culture.
      </h2>

      <p>
        Milk tea has been around the U.S. since the early 90s, but it didn't start becoming mainstream until 2013 when the Fung brother made a Youtube video that was watch by millions. The music video "BobaLife" introduced the unfamiliar drink to all kind of different people. It became synonymous with the Asian-American youth culture.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, milk tea is more than just a drink. Like many other things that have become a token in the Asian-American community, such as rice, dumplings, pho, soy sauce, it's an identity.
