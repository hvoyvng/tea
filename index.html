      <h2>What is Milk Tea</h2>
      <p>
        The history of milke tea originated from Hong Kong, and may have its origins in the introduction of the practice of drinking afternoon tea with milk and sugar under the British colonial rule. The Hong Kong milk tea is made with black tea and evaporated milk or sweetened condensed milk. The tea used is typically a black tea, although other aged tea may also be used such as matcha and assam.
